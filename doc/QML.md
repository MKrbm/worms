I wanted to share some thoughts and ask your opinion again on *the practical use cases of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in our current technological situation*

The following is my current understanding on the discussion of quantum advantage.

- Quantum Supremacy 
  Still a Topic of DebateWe are currently in a phase where the achievement of quantum supremacy is still under discussion. 
  Actually some studies about achiving quantum supremacy have counterarguments that they can simulate the same results on classical computers.

- Simulating Quantum Algorithms on Classical Systems
  - Many quantum algorithms, especially those designed for the present generation of quantum computers, might be simulated using classical algorithms. This is particularly relevant for:
  
    - Noisy Gates: Current quantum gates are error-prone, and their behavior can often be efficiently simulated using tensor networks, although this might require powerful classical computing resources like strong GPUs.

    - Shallow Gates: Quantum circuits with fewer layers of quantum gates (shallow circuits) can also be simulated on classical computers.

  - They make me feel whether we truly need quantum computers for QML applications for the reason of performance and efficientcy with current quantum computers.


In summary, I strongly agree that QML will perform better than classical ML, however I have no idea if it is the case right now, and I want you oppinion on my thought.

Also please don't misunderstand me, but I'm really looking foward to use QML, but I just want to know the current status.

p.s. I didn't consider about the cost. As you said in the meeting, we migh be able to save money by using quantum computers, even though we can do the same thing with classical machine.
