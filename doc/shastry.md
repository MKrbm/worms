# Shastry-Sutherland 

### exact diagonalization for L = [2,2]
- spectrum is saved in `data/shastry_exact.npy`
- At T = 1, $\langle\hat{H}\rangle=-5.58551...$

### Phase diagram

- Dimer singlet ($J/JD = J_1/J_2< 0.68$)
- Plaquette singlet ($0.68 < J_1/J_2 < 0.76$)
- AF Neel ($J_1/J_2 > 0.76$)

It is assumed that in singlet-triplet basis, almost all configuration is $[0,0,...,0]$

## results

Here, we set $J_2$ = 1
### At fixed J1 

Compare with exact diagonalization
- J1 = 1, T = [0.1, ..., 10.0]
