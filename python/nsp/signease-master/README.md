# signease -- A python package to ease the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem, v.1

signease is intended to be a python package that in a mature stage shall allow to compute efficient basis changes of local Hamiltonian models to improve the sampling complexity of quantum Monte-Carlo algorithms. 

The currently implemented functionality of the package is limited to 2-local Hamiltonian and identical on-site orthogonal circuits. It provides the entire 
code used for the numerical study in the publication

We intend to considerably extend the package in the future. 


## Requirements

The code is developed with Python 3.6.7. and uses the following fairly standard packages in some recent version: 
`numpy, scipy, matplotlib, copy, itertools, warnings, os, multiprocessing`.

## Demo 

A simple example use case can be found in `simple_plots_frustrated_Ladder.py`
Run and wait for some time ...
```
	python simple_plots_frustrated_Ladder.py
```
This should display some plots.

## Reproducing the plots of the publication 

Executable examples as presented in the publication are:
	- `produce_j0model_data.py`
	- `produce_randomStoquastic_data.py`
	- `produce_frustratedLadder_data.py`

These scripts use the wrapper
	`f_optimisation.py`
to access the functionality provided by the circuit optimiser module
and use parallelisation to produce the data in the `/data` directory 
for the plots in the publication. With standard desktop computing power 
theses script run for about two hours. Each call of the scripts will
use a different seed for the random generators causing variations in 
the resulting plots. 

Subsequently, running the corresponding plot sripts 
	`plotscript_j0model.py`
	`plotscript_randomStoquastic.py`
	`plotscript_frustratedLadder_full.py`
generates the plot in the `/plot` directory displayed in the publication. 

## Overview 
The core functionality is provided by the classes defined in the `circuitOptimizer` module. 

The most important class types it provides are the follwing:
* The class `Measure` implementing a couple of non-stoquasticity measures.
* The type `Hamiltonian` implements the blue print of a local Hamiltonian model. 
	Specific models should be implement as childrens of the `Hamiltonian` class. 
* The type `Circuit` specifies the blue print of a local quantum circuit consisting of multiple Orthogonal matrices.
	A specific circuit should implement as a subclass of `Circuit`.
* Instances of the `Optimizer` class can perform a conjugate gradient optimisation of 
	an instace of `Measure` for a given Hamiltonian and circuit model, specified by 
	instances of `Hamiltonian` and `Circuit`.




## Contributing

We invite contributions to our code base in order to improve the package and 
make it widely applicable to many Hamiltonian models. Please contact us
